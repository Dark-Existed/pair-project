PM denies knowledge of AWB kickbacks
The Prime Minister has denied he knew AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq despite writing to the wheat exporter asking to be kept fully informed on Iraq wheat sales.
Letters from John Howard and Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile to AWB have been released by the Cole inquiry into the oil for food program.
In one of the letters Mr Howard asks AWB managing director Andrew Lindberg to remain in close contact with the Government on Iraq wheat sales.
The Opposition's Gavan O'Connor says the letter was sent in 2002, the same time AWB was paying kickbacks to Iraq though a Jordanian trucking company.
He says the Government can longer wipe its hands of the illicit payments, which totalled $290 million.
"The responsibility for this must lay may squarely at the feet of Coalition ministers in trade, agriculture and the Prime Minister," he said.
But the Prime Minister says letters show he was inquiring about the future of wheat sales in Iraq and do not prove the Government knew of the payments.
"It would have been astonishing in 2002 if as Prime Minister I hadn't done anything I possibly could to preserve Australia's very valuable wheat market," he said.

Email questions
Today at the inquiry, AWB trading manager Peter Geary has been questioned about an email he received in May 2000.
It indicated that the Iraqi Grains Board had approached AWB to provide "after-sales service".
Mr Geary said he had forwarded the email to two AWB colleagues and did not remember reading it, although he said he may have skimmed it.

Support
AWB still has plenty of support among grain growers in central western New South Wales despite the revelations of the Cole inquiry.
Producers say they broadly support AWB's attempts to get the best prices for their products.
"I think it's all a ploy by overseas interests to try and get the single desk put aside. The stories that are going round about the commission and everything, I think that's the way people have got to do things to do business with the Middle East and Asian countries," one producer said.
"I think it's actually a pretty reasonable system and I think actually I'd give them pretty fair support at the moment. I think on average they've performed fairly well," another producer said.
"The biggest thing about someone else taking over is whether the multinationals will get too much of a foothold in there and take it too much to their advantage."

Grain prices
But an analyst predicts grain prices will drop another $20 a tonne on the back of the inquiry into AWB.
Malcolm Bartholomaeus says pool returns have already dropped by $20 a tonne this year from the average price over the past five years.
He says the premiums that AWB was achieving through its wheat export monopoly have been severely eroded.

SA farmers help fire ravaged neighbours
Farmers in South Australia's south-east are donating truckloads of hay to their neighbours across the border in the wake of the Grampians bushfires.
In just a few days, farmers have donated 250 tonnes of hay, as well as agistment for cattle.
They say that is just the beginning.
Fodder drive coordinator Peter O'Conner says he has been overwhelmed by the response.
"All the hay that's going this week has all gone from places that have donated one load or up to two loads of hay," he said.
"We've got one man that's donated two full loads and the rest are all one loads, straight loads that we're moving this week.

Floodwaters close highway
A major highway between the Northern Territory and Western Australia remains blocked by floodwaters today.
The Victoria River has cut the Victoria Highway and also flooded the remote Pigeon Hole Aboriginal community.
Stockman Simon Ham describes the relocation of a hundred people to higher ground.
"They had all their vehicles moved out of the community and they had a few camps set up and they were moving more people and belongings out with a couple of boats, just onto higher ground, only 500 metres from the community," he said.
"They are up on a sandstone ridge at the moment and I think the river heights might be up for a little longer but I think it [the Victoria River] will start going down."

Grain company sold for $9m
Tasmania's main grain company has changed hands for the second time in just three years.
The former state-owned Tasmanian Grain Elevators Board has been sold to local agribusiness Roberts Limited for about $9 million.
The deal includes silos at Launceston, Devonport and Powranna in northern Tasmania.
John Macleod from Roberts Limited says the company bid when the board was first privatised.
"We were very disappointed we weren't successful at that point of time," he said.

Wine workers stop work
Workers at Hardy Wines' Stanley winery in south-western New South Wales have walked off the job for the second time in a week.
Forty staff walked out this morning in a dispute over a new enterprise bargaining agreement.
The stopwork comes just as the region's wine grape crush gets under way.
Hardy Wines took the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) on Friday.

Wool body eyes sportswear industry
The $50 billion global sportswear industry is the new target of wool promotion body, Australian Wool Innovation (AWI).
AWI is showing wool blend t-shirts and casual wear to manufacturers this week at the largest trade show for the industry being held in Germany.
AWI's Len Stephens says although wool-blend sportswear will be at the pricier end of the market, shoppers are willing to pay more.
"The sports apparel market sector is one of the biggest and certainly the fastest growing apparel sector in the world, and it's no secret that wool hasn't had a very big share of that market at all," he said.
"The level of wool, particularly Australian merino wool in the sports market is really almost below the radar.

Organisation to step up banning rodeos campaign
Tasmania's rodeo industry is under sustained attack from animal rights activists after another animal had to be destroyed at a weekend event.
A bucking horse was put down after breaking a leg at Ulverstone on Saturday.
Two weeks ago, a bull was destroyed after apparently breaking its back during a bull-riding competition at Carrick.
The owner of both animals, Brian Fish, says they were unfortunate accidents and not an animal welfare issue.
But Emma Haswell from Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania says her organisation will up its efforts to have rodeos banned.

Snails used in cancer research
New research is under way to investigate whether South Australian sea snails could eventually be used to treat cancer.
Until now the state's snail population has been virtually unexplored but Flinders University hopes to discover beneficial compounds in predatory sea snails, known as whelks.
Marine biologist Dr Kirsten Benkendorff says the work follows research overseas, where clinical trials are now investigating anti-cancer properties.
"The whelks that I'm looking at at the moment are not currently harvested and not really considered a useful resource so I think that there's a lot of potential economic benefits from that side of things," she said.

Processors fail to meet kangaroo meat demand
International demand for kangaroo meat is putting pressure on Australian processors.
Despite high prices, harvesting quotas are not being met leaving a big gap in the market.
Phil Franolick from King River International Processors in Perth says Europeans are attracted to the meat's low fat content and Russians are consuming large amounts of kangaroo sausages and mince.
"As far as I know every skerrick of manufactured meat that is produced by human consumption processors virtually goes to the Russian market now," he said.

People warned to be on snake alert
With temperatures soaring this summer, particularly in southern Australia, snakes are on the move.
People are being warned to keep their eyes open out in the paddock, especially in areas hit by bushfires, with snakes forced from their usual habitat.
Maria Dovey from Reptile Rescue Tasmania has these words of advice.
"Any people who are regularly outdoors, whether they be camping, bush walking, people who're on the land working, they must always carry at least two bandages with them and a mobile phone," she said.

Aerial spraying begins to control locust threat
Victoria's high country farmers have begun aerial spraying to try to control the threat of locusts.
It is the first time locust plagues have made it to the region, with continued rain and warm weather assisting breeding conditions.
Pastures and crops have already been wiped out by the pest.

Injury won't stop baton runner
A southern Queensland cattle farmer says a knee injury will not stop him running in the Queen's baton relay today in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games.
Stanthorpe's Bill Bonner travelled to Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to run his leg of the relay.
And he says injury will not prevent him from making the 500 metre dash.
"About two weeks ago I was jumping off my motorbike and twisted a ligament in my knee and I haven't been able to do more than walk since," he said.
"But I promise you I will run that baton because you get such an adrenalin rush that I think you could only have one leg and you could still run it."

The NZ apple debate continues
In a New Zealand newspaper on the weekend, members of the New Zealand apple industry voiced concern regarding the legitimacy of the "science" used in the draft Import Risk Analysis put out last month by Biosecurity Australia. The draft Import Risk Analysis (IRA) determines the risk of fireblight and other pests and diseases if New Zealand apples are imported into Australia.
Under the World Trade Organisation's rules Australia can refuse the importation of New Zealand apples if they are able to provide scientific evidence of a substantial disease or pest risk. But according to the New Zealand apple growers, "professional" scientific evidence shows that mature apples imported into Australia pose no risk of fireblight. However the spokesperson for the New Zealand based Australian Apple Access Group Phil Allison says Biosecurity Australia has not provided the mathematical model used to determine the "scientific" evidence stated in the draft IRA.
A spokesperson for Biosecurity Australia said: "the formulas used in the risk assessment are provided in the Draft Import Risk Analysis Report on New Zealand Apples, which was published last December for anyone to read. A competent modeller can reproduce the model used in the risk analysis from the formulas given in the report." The chairman of the fireblight task force, John Corboy, says the response and concern from New Zealand apple growers regarding the draft IRA is not surprising, but Australia has to be able to exercise its right to refuse the apples based on the scientific evidence it has presented in the IRA.

Younger trees producing more pears
A trial plot of young williams pear trees has produced fruit three years after they were planted. Usually the trees don't produce fruit until they're about five or six years old. The trees are part of a five year experimental project, funded by SPC Ardmona through the Canned Fruits Association, Horticulture Australia Limited and the Lenne family orchard - where the trial plot is located.
Horticulture consultant Bas Van Den Ende says the aim of the project is to increase the number of williams pears grown in the future by encouraging the younger trees to produce earlier than usual.

Local federal National MP supports AWB single desk
The federal Member for Parkes, John Cobb, has brought into the debate over the future of AWB. This comes as the Cole inquiry continues to examines AWB's role in the Iraq oil-for-food program. On top of this the National party will today try and reinvent itself. Mr Cobb says he supports the single desk and producers must become far more pro-active. On the issue of the National party's future, he says they will make themselves different from the Liberals. Mr Cobb says they do represent regional areas far better then his Liberal colleagues.

Fish deaths believed to be due to lack of oxygen
The Department of Primary Industries is investigating a big fish kill in the Lachlan River upstream of the Lake Cargelligo Weir. Between 150 and 200 native fish died in the incident earlier this month. District Fisheries Officer Phillip McCarthy says murray cod, bream and golden and silver perch were killed but no introduced species died. He says inquiries suggest the deaths were the result of an increased water flow not chemical poisoning.

Vegetable industry concern on labels
Agriculture group AUSVEG says food labelling laws in Australia are a joke because nobody follows them and enforcement of the rules is non-existent. AUSVEG says consumers are still being fooled into thinking they're buying Australian products because of false or poor labelling.

Red tape slows west Kimberley horticulture
The Kimberley could be WA's food bowl with its top soil, available water and sunshine all year round - though its facing hurdles to expand. Sweet potato grower Paul Higgins still relies on a generator and says Broome horticulturalists are the only ones in the state not connected to the grid. He and his neighbours have been applying to get a nine kilometre extension to the current grid system to bring them into line. A spokesperson from Western Power says it is possible, though it's up to customers to pay for their connection costs, regardless of the distance from the existing grid. Land acquisition is also causing headaches. Mr Higgins purchased adjoining country last June, though still hasn't received title. He can't improve the land until this is cleared. "All the issues have been resolved - area surveyed, native title issues have been put to bed, monies have been paid, but still we don't have land title. We can't clear the land, apply for water title, can't do anything," he said. The Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah McTiernan, says the seven month delay is regrettable and Mr Higgins should have been made aware of the hold up in the West Australian Planning Office because the land was not correctly zoned. Though Ms McTiernan says the delay may have worked in his favour, given the land was sold at 2004 property prices. Mr Higgins still waits for the official all clear before he can start ploughing the Pindan for more potatoes.

Richmond River to stay open to fishers
The Department of Primary Industries has decided against closing the Richmond River to commercial and recreational fishers in the wake of last week's fish kill. About 300 dead fish and eels were discovered near Wardell last Thursday, when oxygen levels in the water dropped alarmingly. The acting director of fisheries management, Anthony Hirst, says inspectors will take further samples from the river tomorrow.

Rural woman finalist
The next 10 days may seem like an eternity for one at least one Rosebank farmer. Catherine Ford is one of three finalists in the quest to find the New South Wales Rural Woman of the Year.
The macadamia producer hopes a win in the event will help her to produce a guide promoting sustainability in the industry, but she admits she's amazed to have even made it this far.

DSE 'is carrying out proactive Grampians burning off'
On the rural report yesterday we heard farmers and CFA officers say they feel the intensity of the Grampians fires could have been lessened if more fuel reduction burns had been carried out in the national park. Charley DeFegley, who's the Ararat VFF branch secretary and a CFA divisional commander, said he felt not enough burning off had been carried out and this had contributed to the destructive force of the fire. But the Department of Sustainability's fire manager for the Horsham district and incident controller for the Grampians fires, Geoff Evans, says the agency has a proactive burning off policy. He says burning off is hampered because some landowners are not keen about burning off beside their properties and the weather does not allow controlled burns at some times of the year, giving a very small window of opportunity. He says there is also strong division within the community about whether more or less burning off should be carried out in the national park. But Mr Evans says about 5,000 to 8,000 hectares of the park are burnt off every year.

Farmers and ag agencies get speedy aid to farmers
The state government has announced it will commit millions of dollars to the recovery effort for the new year bushfires including the blaze in the Grampians and a ministerial task force is to start assessing need. The government says it will also help landowners facing hardship as a result of their water supplies being used by firefighting. But already, Department of Primary Industry officers, the Victorian Farmers Federation, haulage contractors and farmers all over western Victoria, have been working at a grassroots level to help fire affected landowners. Hundreds of tonnes of hay, 21 semi-loads of which was brought to a collection point at Moyston from Warrnambool yesterday, has been donated to farmers who need fodder for their surviving animals. Bruce McKay says he has been on farms helping to put sheep down and fixing fencing in the Willaura area. Tim Wrench from the Warrnambool Coop says people came from all around the area to donate hay.
